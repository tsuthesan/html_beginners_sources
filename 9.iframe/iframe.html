      <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to
write Web Pages.
 Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
 As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to
simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure
it to display.
Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information
between researchers.
Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available
in HTML language.</p>
